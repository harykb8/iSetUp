      <h2 class="project-tagline">iSetUp is a open source Cydia application that can handle setting up themes from winterboard. Looking for contributors to help finish creating this app for the sake of helping users with a front end app to set up their themes and stop harassing Jay Freemen &quot;Saurik&quot; or the creators for simple knowledge! </h2>

      <p>iSetUp (2012)
Created by FreeAppl3 
Open Source - "Public Build"</p>

<p>Open source code. Our main objective at this point is to get root access. The aaplication itself needs to run off root of the device
and allow permissions to read/write 0755 on all files on the device. I have the app set up know were it can detect theme set ups 
by adding a structure in the theme. The structure is within the base theme in WinterBoard. "BaseTheme.theme/iSetUp/" Inside iSetUp folder 
you want to see 4 more folders "XML,html,plist,UserPhotos" and an image 600x200px called thumbnail.png.</p>

<p>If you need further guidence just check the code and see the directories being used. Feel free to do as you please witin reason. 
This app has the ability to do anything you want it to do just remember that, there are no limitations but the overall goal
is to provide theme creators a way to give there users a better experience. This in returns leads to happy customers, less emails to creatprs and possibly more sales. 
From a users stand point damn just let me use this theme already! I think users get deterd from themes due to the difficult set ups
and we can solve a lot of this. Weather widgets... a sinch...photo widgets with a touch of a button....Details,channel logs all right
there at the users leasure!</p>

<p>Overview the code, download it, play aroud and see what you can come up with. All users involved will be listed within the apps credits.
Take into consideration we are not trying to write a new winterboard just give users the ability to set up winterboard themes
without having to SSH or do some behind the scences actions. We an provide them with a friendly helpful simple interface to make "themes at ease"</p>
